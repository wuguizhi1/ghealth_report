# Process of 16srna data analysis
* This process used to do regular analysis of 16srna sequencing data
* sequencing platform : **miseq**

## part1 split library data from miseq run
* two methods for library build with different format Samplesheet.csv
* use library samplesheet info split data to each sample

## part2 sample's data get taxnomy and KEGG results
* use usearch and picrust tools
